Baby 
I really hope we never lose each other.
I know you have a lot of anxieties about me moving on or not wanting to be with you anymore for whatever reason and I have my own anxieties about you losing feelings for me 
But I have never wanted to be with anyone this way.
It’s not a short term goal for me
I want to come see you and it’s not a question of whether we would get along well in person I don’t see how that would change for me 
I just want to be with you
I want to be able to hold your hand and kiss you and sleep together 
I want to make you lunches 
I want to laugh with you at night while we’re trying to sleep 
I want to talk to you forever 
I want to watch our cats eat new foods 
I want to love your friends and family and get them lots of nice things to eat and make them feel happy and comfortable 
I want to listen to you do homework 
I want to have kids with you
I want to be happy together 
I hold back from saying a lot I know it’s mostly you saying you love me throughout the day and I don’t know if I show how much I care but I love you so much alihan
Maybe you’re not perfect to you but you’re perfect for me 
I know that if I ended up with you I would never stop smiling because you wouldn’t let me 
You’re always there when I hesitate 
You sit me down and you’re so sweet and loving  and gentle 
I want to go to school and be good for you 
I want to do well so I can take care of you and help with any stress you have 
I want you to be loved the way you’ve always deserved 
I don’t care if you never work 
I don’t care if you grow old 
I don’t care if we don’t have a not of money or nice things 
If I look over and see you grabbing the cats and cackling i would be so content 
I know that because just thinking  of it made me smile 
I love how you talk to me 
Even when you’re being playful and teasing me 
I love the way you say my name and all the sweet pet names and words you say 
You never made me feel like I had to work to get love from you 
Somehow I’m lucky enough to get all the love I didn’t think I deserved from you for  basic things like laughing or working out with you:
I think about you a lot 
I think of you when I eat yummy things 
I think of you when I’m walking around 
I think of you when I laugh when my friends and I know they would love you 
I think of you when I feed cats because I know you’d be excited to come with me and take care of them 
If I went to every temple and mosque and prayed I would pray for you to always be happy and feel loved 
And I would do anything for that even if someone told me the only way to see you happy was to disappear I would .
Tbh I haven’t had the best outlook on marriage it used to scare me a lot and I would always get irritated at the thought 
But with you I want that 
Not because it’s convenient 
It’s because I know you’d never do anything to make me unhappy 
I feel like if we were together and had a future together  it would be a loving one
We wouldn’t ever try to do things to be spiteful  and we would take it a step at a time
But I don’t want to say that and make you feel like you have to commit to something with me  because I just want to give you something more than just physical affection and sweet words 
I want to make you feel loved and valued because to me you’re irreplaceable 
I know you’re worried that you’ll get replaced and I can’t stop you from worrying but I can reassure you that it won’t happen because I just don’t see people as replaceable 
If we fell apart  from my perspective it would never be because of you 
It would be circumstances not being right which we can’t control 
I don’t vocalize as much as you do about girls but whenever I do get approached and get asked out or for my number I feel so bored at the idea because I already know where my heart is 
Even when we met and I would get scolded or teased about how I need to get over you
I never understood why everyone else was so worried about my feelings and what I should do with them
Aaaaa I really hope I don’t sound stupid 
I just kept typing. What came into my head 
I don’t know 
I just really love you and I don’t want you to think that you’re just a convenient option I’ll get tired of 
Ever since I came to Korea I haven’t once thought of dating anyone 
You’re the only one who makes me feel safe enough to even think about it
I don’t know I think I’m repeating myself  
In my perfect world 
You and I are happy 
We haven’t gotten sick of eachother 
We do chores together and laugh and talk while we do them 
Our home is warm and filled with laughter 
And anyone who comes to visit us is always welcomed 
we do our best to make each other feel special and everything is calm 
I know how hard you’ve been working and I’m so proud of you 
I’m so happy that you’re in my life 
You’ve given me everything I could ever ask for by just existing  here 
I don’t know if things will change for you in a week month or year but I want you to know that I’ll never stop loving you 
Il never regret knowing you 
And I’ll always do my best for you
I want to heal some of the damage that was done by others not appreciating you and hurting you carelessly 
I don’t know if that’s  wrong for me to say but I want you to know that you’re enough 
You can say you love me a million times in 3 second and it won’t get old or be too much 
You can ask me to be around more or less and that would be okay 
You can be overly affectionate if you want and it’s not cringe 
I think it’s so silly to dismiss someone’s emotions that way and call them cringey for just showing their feelings 
You can cry if you need to 
My feelings aren’t the weather my love 
They won’t change  this easily and you aren’t temporary 
You mean a lot to me and I hope that I can make you feel happy everyday 
I’m going to shut up now 
I hope you have some nice dreams baby 
I hope you do so well on your exam 
And I hope that you can walk through your door feeling less drained 
Mwah
